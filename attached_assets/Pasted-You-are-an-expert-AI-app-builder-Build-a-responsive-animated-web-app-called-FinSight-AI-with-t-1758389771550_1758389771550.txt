You are an expert AI app builder. Build a responsive, animated web app called **FinSight AI** with the following:

🔹 Purpose:
An AI-powered financial co-pilot for MSPs that detects revenue leaks (unbilled work, SLA breaches) and IT cost waste (unused SaaS licenses). 

🔹 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (animations) + Recharts (charts)
- Backend: Node.js API + Python microservice for AI analysis
- AI: LangChain or CrewAI + OpenAI GPT for contract/log/license analysis
- Storage: SQLite or Postgres for results, AWS S3 for file uploads

🔹 Core Features:
1. **File Uploads**
   - Upload contracts (PDF/DOC), work logs (CSV/JSON), license data (CSV/Excel)
   - Drag-and-drop upload box with animation
   - Show file preview with progress bar

2. **Contract Intelligence Agent**
   - AI parses contracts + compares with logs
   - Flags unbilled work, SLA breaches, mispriced clauses
   - Displays results in an animated expandable card view

3. **License Waste Finder**
   - Analyzes SaaS license usage
   - Detects unused or duplicate subscriptions
   - Shows savings with animated progress counters

4. **Financial Insights Dashboard**
   - Responsive dashboard with 2 panels:
     - MSP Revenue Leakage 💸
     - Client Cost Waste 💰
   - Animated charts (Recharts with transitions)
   - Toggle switch to flip between **MSP View** and **Client View**

5. **AI Proposal Generator**
   - Generates a draft proposal
   - Editable in a text editor card
   - Animated “Copy to Clipboard” button

🔹 Pages:
- **Home Page**: Hero section with animated headline, “Upload Your Data” button
- **Upload Page**: Drag-and-drop upload with animation
- **Analysis Page**: Animated cards showing leaks and waste
- **Dashboard Page**: Charts with MSP/Client toggle
- **Proposal Page**: AI-generated proposal, copyable text

🔹 UI/UX Requirements:
- Fully responsive (mobile + tablet + desktop)
- Clean, minimal UI with modern design
- Use Framer Motion for:
  - Page transitions (fade/slide)
  - Animated toggles for switching views
  - Expandable analysis result cards
  - Counters that animate numbers up
- Use Tailwind for styling with a professional palette (blue, green, gray shades)

🔹 Demo Data:
- Include a sample contract (PDF text)
- Sample work logs (CSV)
- Sample SaaS license data (CSV)
- So the app runs a demo without needing external setup

🔹 Deliverable:
A functional MVP web app with responsive, animated UI, ready to present in a hackathon demo. Focus on usability, wow-factor animations, and financial insights dashboard.
